        "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **If you want to skill up, check out [my guide to getting started](https://neelnanda.io/getting-started), and if you want to jump into an open problem check out my sequence [200 Concrete Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability](https://neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems).**\n",
        "\n",
        "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
        "\n",
        "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://neelnanda.io/exploratory-analysis-demo) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

From a computational perspective, we know exactly what operations are going on inside (even if we don't know what they mean!). And we can make precise, surgical edits and see how the model's behaviour and other internals change. This is an extremely powerful tool, because it can let us eg set up careful counterfactuals and causal intervention to easily understand model behaviour. \n",

As the model is run, it computes that activation as normal, and then the hook function is applied to compute a replacement, and that is substituted in for the activation. The hook function can be an arbitrary Python function, so long as it returns a tensor of the correct shape.\n",

        "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",

We do this by setting up a **clean prompt** and a **corrupted prompt** and a **metric** for performance on the task.

We want language models to be able to take in arbitrary text as input, but the transformer architecture needs the inputs to be elements of a fixed, finite vocabulary.

The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

        "In transformer interpretability, we often need to analyse low rank factorized matrices - a matrix $M = AB$, where M is `[large, large]`, but A is `[large, small]` and B is `[small, large]`. This is a common structure in transformers, and the `FactoredMatrix` class is a convenient way to work with these. It implements efficient algorithms for various operations on these, such as computing the trace, eigenvalues, Frobenius norm, singular value decomposition, and products with other matrices. It can (approximately) act as a drop-in replacement for the original matrix, and supports leading batch dimensions to the factored matrix. \n",

They find a pretty dramatic shift in models during training - there's a brief period where models go from not having induction heads to having them, which leads to the models suddenly becoming much better at in-context learning (using far back tokens to predict the next token, eg over 500 words back). This is enough of a big deal that it leads to a visible *bump* in the loss curve, where the model's rate of improvement briefly increases. "
